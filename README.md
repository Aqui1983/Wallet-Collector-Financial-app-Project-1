# **Project-1-Repo-AQML**
##### *Authors: Anthony Quiles and Marc Leipold*
## **Project Description**
### **Goal:**
#### Our goal was to creat a financial app that could be a one stop shop for all your crypto needs. This our first step to making that happen. 

### **About:**
#### We have created a financial application that can aggregate all of your wallet balances in one central and convenient place. In addition to that we have also provided you with some unique ways to look at and analyse your balances as well as a cool dashboard to let you have a snapshot of the crypto markets at a glance.

## **Wallet Aggregator**
#### The wallet aggregator was pretty straight forward and Marc did an excellent job with this. 
- #### He started first with establishing the lists we would need  as well as the network selection box and a text box to input the wallet address.
'''
{
    
    blockchain_list = ["bitcoin", "dogecoin", "ethereum", "xrp"]

    blockchain_selection = st.sidebar.selectbox("Please select the blockchain for your wallet:", blockchain_list)

    wallet_address = st.sidebar.text_input("Please enter your wallet address")

    record_df = pd.read_csv('database.csv')

    total_value_asset = None

    crypto_id = ""

    asset_weights = ""

    token = None
}
'''
- #### We also set some empty lists for the total value of all of the coins, coin id(for identification in wallet balance API), asset weights(percentage of each coin in respect to the total balance of assets), and token(this is used for the current price API for each coin).
- #### I added the record_df to store the wallet address information in a csv for easier analysis and inclusion into our visualizations.
- #### Marc created the If statements for the Network selection and I intergrated the current price call into that as well.
'''
{
        
    if blockchain_selection == "ethereum":
        network_selection = 'goerli'
        crypto_id = '1027'
        token = 'ethereum'
    elif blockchain_selection == "bitcoin":
        network_selection = 'testnet'
        crypto_id = '1'
        token = 'bitcoin'
    elif blockchain_selection == "dogecoin":
        network_selection = 'testnet'
        crypto_id = '74'
        token = 'dogecoin'
    elif blockchain_selection == "xrp":
        network_selection = 'testnet'
        crypto_id = '52'
        token = 'ripple'
    else:
        st.error("You have not chosen a compatible network")
}
'''
- #### Marc then created the aggregator API function using an API from [https://rest.cryptoapis.io] that initiates on the press of the 'Enter' button. I added the variables thatrepresented the cleaned data inside of this function. Since the data is in json format I dumped the json and made df's and variables from the data and sent the wallet addresses to the database.csv file. We also drop duplicates here as well to avoid doublingon the amount of specific coins. The solution to integrating the current price was a struggle to find but once Smerling suggested what we should actually do it became so simple and elegant.

            price_data = requests.get(GetPrice(token)).json()

            price = price_data['data'][crypto_id]['quotes']['USD']['price']

            last_price = price_data['data'][crypto_id]['quotes']['USD']['price']

            total_value_asset = amount * round(price,2)

            record = [wallet_address, coin, amount, price, total_value_asset]
            
            record_df.loc[len(record_df.index)] = record
            
            record_df.to_csv('database.csv', index = False)

            record_df.drop_duplicates(subset='Address', keep='last', inplace=True)
        
        
            record_df.drop_duplicates(keep='last', inplace=True)
            
            #st.write(record_df.keys())
            
            assets_total = record_df[record_df.keys()[-1]].sum()

- #### So this is the base of our app that we use to power almost all of the visuals that we have in our app.

## **Visualizations**
#### The visualizations were pretty tricky but very fun to do, they consist of a vertical bar chart, 2 pie charts, a candlestick chart, monte carlo simulation plot, and a regular bar chart.

- #### Marc was in charge of the Monte carlo plot, a bar chart representing the value of each coin, and a pie chart thatshows the percentage breakdown of all coins in the aggregator.
- #### I was in charge of a table of assets, pie chart that shows total assets vs annual income, candle stick chart with a couple of indicators, and the bar chart that shows percentage change over the last 7 day, 24hrs and 1 hr for the top 100 coins.
### **Monte Carlo**
- #### We started by adusting some of the code in MCForecastTools to make it work for cryptocurrency. I switched the trading days from 252 to 365 and I also adjusted some column names for the data being read in. After that Marc brought in some historical price data for the 4 coins in our wallet and then customized the MCSimulation to accept custom variables that the user would choose on a slider and weight variables that were calculated before hand when we cleaned the data. We printed out the resulting plot and some additional analytical information from summarize_cumulative_return() attribute.
'''
{

        # Monte Carlo Section

    #mc_years_list = ['5', '10', '15', '20', '25', '30']

    #st.write(mc_years_list)

    years = st.slider('How many years into the future do you want to see?', min_value=1, max_value=10, step=1)
    Bitcoin = 'BTC-USD'
    Ethereum = 'ETH-USD'
    Ripple = 'XRP-USD'
    Dogecoin = 'DOGE-USD'

    # Download Stock Data

    #st.write("# Download Stock Data")

    BTC = yf.download(Bitcoin, period="max", interval="1d")
    ETH = yf.download(Ethereum, period="max", interval="1d")
    XRP = yf.download(Ripple, period="max", interval="1d")
    DOG = yf.download(Dogecoin, period="max", interval="1d")

    # Starting to clean dataframes and get them ready to concact
    All_coins_hist_df = pd.concat([BTC, ETH, XRP, DOG],axis=1, keys=['BTC', 'ETH', 'XRP', 'DOG'])
    All_coins_hist_df = All_coins_hist_df.dropna()

    Monte_carlo_sim = MCSimulation(
        portfolio_data = All_coins_hist_df,
        weights = [btc_pct, eth_pct, xrp_pct, doge_pct],
        num_simulation = 500,
        num_trading_days = 365 * years
    )
    daily_returns_df = Monte_carlo_sim.calc_cumulative_return()
    #st.write(daily_returns_df)

    line_plot_MC_sim = Monte_carlo_sim.plot_simulation()
    plt.savefig('image1.png')
    img=plt.imread('image1.png')
    st.image(img)

    tbl_5yr = Monte_carlo_sim.summarize_cumulative_return()

    st.write(tbl_5yr)
}
'''
### **Pie Charts**
- #### We were both in charge of a pie chart each and they were both pretty straight forward with just different approaches and libraries of plotly.
- #### I used graph_objects in plotly to make my chart and I also included a field in the sidebar for the user to enter their annual income: 
'''
{

    #Annual income vs Investments Pie chart
    Annual_Income = st.sidebar.text_input("Please enter your Annual Income")
    colors = ['green','gold']
    assets_total = record_df[record_df.keys()[-1]].sum()
    fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Pie(labels=['My Annual Income', 'Total Investments'],
                                values=[Annual_Income, assets_total])])
    fig.update_traces(hoverinfo='label+percent', textinfo='value', textfont_size=20,
                    marker=dict(colors=colors, line=dict(color='#000000', width=2)))
    col2.write(fig)
}
'''

- #### Marc used plotly express to make his pie chart to show the percentage makeup of all the coins in the portfolio:

'''
{

    ### Pie Chart coin percentages
    chart = functools.partial(st.plotly_chart, use_container_width=True)

    col3.subheader("Value of each Symbol")
    col3.write("Pie Chart")


    pie_chart = px.pie(
        record_df, 
        values=record_df.keys()[-1], 
        names=record_df.keys()[1],
        #**COMMON_ARGS
        )

    pie_chart.update_layout(margin=dict(t=0, b=0, l=0, r=0))

    col3.write(pie_chart)
}
'''

### **Bar Charts**
- #### We were both in charge of a bar chart with Marc making one for the dollar value of each coin in the portfolio and my chart being the result of a web scraper function to display the top 100 performing coins as part of our dashboard.
